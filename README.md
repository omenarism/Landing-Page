###Thanks to The Odin Project
For guiding me on how to write the webpage in order that is easy to follow.

1. Write the structure of the html, although not perfect, it is good to write it first and add more div later on during styling in CSS.
2. Only during styling in CSS did I get the gist of what is needed to be added in html
3. Lots of display:flex 
4. Lots of googling also
5. Lots of looking into what I did in the past exercises
6. Always read what The Odin Project stated, especially the 'dont sweat it too much' when I reduce the screen size to make it responsive
